# UI Viewer Implementation Prompt

**Role:** Senior Frontend Engineer (Expert in React, Tailwind, and Data Visualization).
**Task:** Build a "Rita Simulation Viewer" for log files generated by the Rita Framework.

## 1. Requirements

### 1.1 Input
- Accept a `.jsonl` file via **Drag and Drop**.
- Parse the file into a structured timeline.

### 1.2 Layout
- **Left Panel (The Pulse):** A vertical, trace-centric timeline. Group logs by `traceId`. Use color coding for different components (Interactions = Green, Use Cases = Blue, Policies = Purple, Gateways = Yellow).
- **Center Panel (The State):** If a log entry contains a `snapshot`, render a beautiful, nested card view of that data. If the domain is "Kitchen", try to use a grid layout representing kitchen stations.
- **Right Panel (The Inspecter):** Full JSON tree of the selected log entry's metadata.

### 1.3 Playback Controls
- A slider at the bottom to "Time Travel" through the logs.
- Advancing the slider should update the Center Panel to show the latest snapshot for each entity.

## 2. Technical Stack
- Framework: Next.js or Vite + React.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS.
- Icons: Lucide React.
- Component Library: Shadcn UI (optional but preferred).

## 3. High-Fidelity Details
- **Linear vs Trace:** Allow toggling between a pure chronological view and a grouped "Trace View".
- **Diff Highlights:** If a log has an `evolution` field, highlight the specific fields that changed in the `snapshot`.
- **Flow Visualization:** Draw lines/arrows between components within the same `traceId` to show the execution path (e.g. Interaction -> Use Case -> Policy).

## 4. Example Data Structure
Assume the input is an array of objects matching the `LOGS_SPEC.md`.

**PROMPT TO LLM:**
"I have a JSONL log file from a back-end simulation framework. Each line is a JSON object with `traceId`, `component`, `message`, `snapshot`, and `evolution`. Please build a React-based viewer that allows me to drag-and-drop this file and visualize the execution. Focus on a vertical timeline that can be toggled between linear time and trace-grouped views. When I click a log entry, show the `snapshot` data in a clean dashboard view. Use Tailwind for a dark-themed, professional 'Observability' look."
